## Introduction

Welcome to the "Algo" repository! This unique space is dedicated to the exploration and mastery of various algorithmic problems. It serves as a personal journey through the vast landscape of algorithmic challenges, showcasing the solutions and techniques I've applied to overcome them.

## Content

This repository contains a wide range of algorithmic problems from beginner to advanced levels. Each problem is accompanied by a solution, written in a way that emphasizes understanding and learning. The solutions are well-documented, with comments explaining the logic and thought process behind them. This makes the repository not only a record of solved problems but also a valuable resource for learning and understanding algorithms.

## Structure

The repository is organized by problem type or data structure used, making it easy to navigate and find specific problems. Each problem is contained in its own directory, which includes the problem statement, solution code, and any relevant notes or additional resources.

## Purpose

The main goal of the Algo repository is to track my progress as I delve into algorithmic problem-solving. However, it also serves as a resource for others who are on a similar journey. Whether you're a fellow student, a professional looking to brush up on your skills, or someone just starting out in the world of algorithms, I hope you find this repository useful.

## Usage

To use this repository, simply clone it to your local machine. You can then navigate through the directories to explore the problems and solutions at your own pace.

Thank you for visiting the Algo repository. Happy coding!
